"# HR-Management-System" 

To maintain the data of all active and inactive employees requires a significant amount of time if we do it 
without software.Every organization has their own human resources in order to perform the internal and 
external human resource activities. Among the total human resource activities, managing the human 
capital i.e. employees is the significant task to any HR. The main function of HR is to recruit, manage and 
store the employee data which includes their personal information including their job roles, job streams, 
projects allotted, salaries and many more which allows them to face huge workload. In order to support 
the HR’s there are some electronic based HR systems called HRMS- human resource management system. 
Organizations should maintain HRMS software with a huge number of client server applications, service 
providers as well as control tools. But this application is cost effective one that allows them to manage 
their employee’s data in a simple manner. This human resource management system will allow the HR’s 
to manage the timings of employee works, employee information systems, employees recruitment, 
employees training, employee retention and performance appraisal, employee service and employee 
attendance. This project belongs to a category of web application that can be accessed through PC with 
internet connection.
